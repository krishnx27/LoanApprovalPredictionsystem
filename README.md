Loan Approval Prediction System (Python)
This project implements a machine learning system to predict loan approvals based on applicant dataPrerequisites:

Prerequisites:-
Python 3.x (with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook (or similar IDE)

Usage:-
The Jupyter notebook guides you through the process of:

Data Loading: Load the loan applicant data from a CSV file.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for model training.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model to predict loan approvals based on applicant features.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict loan approvals for new applicants.
